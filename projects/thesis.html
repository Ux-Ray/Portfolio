    <h1>Exploring Comics in Photovoice</h1>
    <p><strong>How a digital storytelling tool helped students reflect on gender-based discrimination.</strong></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis explored how <strong>comic-based digital storytelling</strong> could complement
        the <strong>Photovoice methodology</strong>, especially for sensitive topics such as
        gender-based discrimination among university students. The project combined
        questionnaires, a focus group, and usability improvements to the
        <em>Communics</em> platform.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional Photovoice relies on photography and discussion, but photos
        alone can be limiting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Privacy concerns may stop participants from sharing certain images.</li>
        <li>Abstract or emotional experiences are hard to capture with photos.</li>
        <li>Complex issues risk being underrepresented.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <p><strong>Comics lowered barriers to expression.</strong> Students felt safer and more creative when using comic panels compared to photography.</p>
      <p><strong>Time efficiency.</strong> Creating stories in Communics was faster than taking photos over several days.</p>
      <p><strong>Privacy protection.</strong> Comics allowed participants to share sensitive experiences without exposing themselves.</p>
      <div class="quote">
        “I preferred working with Communics because discrimination often occurs through communication or interaction, which is hard to capture in a single picture.”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I co-designed lightweight improvements for <em>Communics</em> with the platform’s programmer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplified user flow to reduce decision fatigue.</li>
        <li>Improved usability and customization options.</li>
        <li>Explored potential of AI to suggest dialogues or visuals.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>Evaluation results showed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity Support Index (CSI):</strong> average score of 72, indicating strong creativity support.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> UMUX-LITE score above benchmark.</li>
        <li><strong>Group engagement:</strong> Communics visuals were rated clearer and more effective than photos (<em>p = .031</em>).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="quote">
        “Communics felt quicker… in traditional Photovoice, I had to spend about a week taking photos.”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Designing for sensitive issues requires balancing usability with emotional safety.
        I learned that <strong>digital storytelling tools can reduce barriers to participation</strong>
        while still enabling meaningful reflection. Participants were excited about
        AI features, but reminded me that technology should <em>support</em> users,
        not replace their voices.
