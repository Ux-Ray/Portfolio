              <p class="body-text">
                As part of a university course project in qualitative research, the goal of our study was to
                explore how people perceive safety and trust in the context of future public transportation
                systems equipped with self-driving technology, specifically autonomous buses. Since “trust”
                is one of the main non-technological barriers to adoption, our focus was on understanding
                people’s concerns and the factors that influence their sense of safety.

              <p class="body-text">
                One of the main challenges of this project was that autonomous buses do not yet operate in our city. 
                We could not directly observe them, and most people had never experienced one in real life. To address this, 
                we designed our study around regular bus usage, investigating passengers’ behaviors, opinions, and concerns 
                as a way to approximate how people might perceive autonomous buses.

    <p class="body-text methods__intro">
      Since autonomous buses are not yet available, we grounded our study in the context of regular bus usage.
      We conducted observations both inside buses and at bus stops, and complemented them with online research.
      These observations informed the design of our interviews and focus group sessions, where participants were
      encouraged to reflect not only on their everyday experiences with regular buses but also to project their
      expectations and concerns onto the concept of autonomous buses.

<section class="section findings">

    <h2 class="section-title">Findings</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
      Our research revealed two main areas of concern when imagining autonomous buses: 
      safety perceptions and the role of the driver.
    </p>

    <div class="findings-grid">
      <!-- Card 1 -->
      <div class="finding-card">
        <h3 class="finding-title">Safety Perceptions</h3>
        <img src="assets/social.png" alt="Safety illustration" class="finding-img">
        <p class="body-text">
          Participants distinguished between <strong>physical safety</strong> (risk of accidents) 
          and <strong>social safety</strong> (interactions with passengers, authority presence). 
          Social safety was the greater concern, with many fearing that removing the driver would 
          reduce their sense of security.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Card 2 -->
      <div class="finding-card">
        <h3 class="finding-title">The Role of the Driver</h3>
        <img src="assets/driver4.png" alt="Driver illustration" class="finding-img">
        <p class="body-text">
          Drivers do more than drive: they handle <strong>unexpected events</strong>, 
          <strong>communicate</strong> with others on the road, and reassure passengers. 
          Without them, the bus atmosphere would change, as passengers already create 
          “privacy bubbles” to cope with shared space.

<!-- WHY THESE FINDINGS MATTER ------------------------------------>


<section class="section findings-matter">
  <div class="container">

    <!-- Full-width header + intro -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why These Findings Matter</h2>
    <p class="body-text ">
      Our findings revealed that safety perceptions are shaped not only by technical reliability
      but also by social context. This has important consequences for how autonomous buses are
      designed and introduced.
    </p>

    <!-- Row: key points (left) + image (right) -->
    <div class="findings-matter__row">
      <div class="matter-list">
        <h3 class="keypoint">Safety is Social as Well as Technical</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
          Passengers emphasized that feeling safe depends on interactions, authority presence,
          and shared space , not just the risk of accidents.
        </p>

        <h3 class="keypoint">Drivers Provide More Than Driving</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
          Beyond technical control, drivers act as communicators, problem-solvers, and sources
          of reassurance. Their absence would alter the social atmosphere of the bus.
        </p>

        <h3 class="keypoint">Design Implication</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
          For autonomous buses to gain trust, they must recreate this sense of social safety —
          balancing reliable technology with features that support reassurance, order, and comfort
          in shared travel.
