      <h2 class="findings-title">
        And as we listened closer, we found that most complaints weren’t about
        missing features but about broken expectations
      </h2>
  
      <p class="findings-intro">
        We reviewed over 100 public posts from real LinkedIn users. The frustration wasn’t loud, it was quiet
        and steady. People weren’t asking for radical new tools. They wanted the platform to meet expectations it had already set.
      </p>
      <p class="findings-intro">
        Things like accurate filters, meaningful alerts, and a sense that their actions—like applying—had weight.
        But instead, they felt misaligned with the system that was supposed to guide them.

            <p class="finding-text">
              Users face challenges in effectively tracking their submitted applications and often find
              that status updates within LinkedIn are inconsistent or not provided by all companies.

            <p class="finding-text">
              Easy Apply makes things faster, but it often feels too generic. Without room to personalize,
              it’s easy to get lost in the crowd while recruiters get overwhelmed by volume.
