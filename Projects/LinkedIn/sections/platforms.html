        LinkedIn had the reach. But others offered something users quietly craved.

      <p class="platforms-intro">
        We compared LinkedIn to other platforms like Indeed, StepStone, and Glassdoor. While LinkedIn led in
        visibility and volume, it fell short on user control. Competitors offered features like clearer application status,
        smarter filters, and more tailored alerts. These may seem small, but to a job seeker, they create a sense of
        progress and clarity. It became clear that LinkedIn’s opportunity wasn’t in doing more—it was in doing the right
        things better.
