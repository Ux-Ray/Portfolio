            Users blame the market. But maybe the tools are the real problem.

          <p class="learnings-text">
            Our research showed how job seekers judge the market based on their own
            experience, while hiring managers struggle to fill roles despite open
            positions. This disconnect is not about a lack of jobs or talent, it is about
            tools that no longer match how both sides work today.
          </p>
          <p class="learnings-text">
            By focusing on the seeker’s journey, our solution addresses one part of this
            broken link and hints at how the entire market could be redefined to bring
            both sides closer.

        What started with silence became a case for designing with empathy, not urgency.

      <p class="learnings-note">
        This project reminded us that people don’t disengage because the process is
        broken. They disengage because it feels like no one is listening. By listening
        closely and solving for trust—not just function—we saw how small, intentional
        changes could bring clarity to an emotionally heavy experience. That’s where
        good UX lives. Not in clever ideas, but in quiet confidence.
