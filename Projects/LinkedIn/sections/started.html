      <h2 class="big-claim">At first, we thought people were frustrated by rejection, but they were actually frustrated by being ignored</h2>
      <p class="sublead">It began with a single quote that kept coming up: “I apply and never hear anything back.”</p>
      <p class="sublead">We wanted to know if this was rare or widespread. What we found was a clear pattern: people were not frustrated by rejection, but by the lack of response, clarity, or progress.</p>
